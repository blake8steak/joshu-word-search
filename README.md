I created this project for the UT Austin Japanese homework website JOSHU (Japanese Online Self-Help Utility.)

This was my first time working with both Defold and Lua, and I hope to continue to improve my understanding of both with time.

I really enjoyed working on this, and I hope you find this helpful!
